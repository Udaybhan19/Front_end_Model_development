# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection & Segmentation Mobile App

This repository provides an **AI-powered plant disease detection and semantic segmentation system** designed for **mobile applications**. The segmentation pipeline is built on top of **MMSegmentation** using the **InternImage** backbone, with a **FastAPI-based backend** for real-time inference.

The system focuses on **20 common plant diseases** (e.g., spot, blight, rot, rust) and is optimized for accuracy, scalability, and deployment readiness.
